### What is MVC?

MVC (Model View Controller) is a design pattern where you split the application into three layers.  
Model, view and controller.  
Each of these components are designed to handle a different aspect.

1. Model: Represents the objects in our application.
2. View: All the html files that are responsible for UI or any front end input/output.
3. Controller: A component that hooks the database with functions, and functions with views.
