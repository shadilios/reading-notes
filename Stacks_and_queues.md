# Stacks & Queues


### What's a stack?

Just like a linked list, but imagine the list consists of a list of books that you place in a box that has the dimensions of each book, you can't reach the first book you placed unless you unpack all the books above it.  
and it follows 2 main rules:  
- FILO (First In Last Out):    
This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

- LIFO (Last In First Out):  
This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

### Stack's functionalities:

1. Push: Add an element to the stack.
2. Pop: removes an element from the stack.
3. Peek: Checks the top element of the stack.
4. isEmpty: returns true or false depending on wether the stack is full or empty.

### What's a queue?

A collection of objects that follow the FIFO(First in first out) rule, imagine a line of production that you place a box on to gather things inside it, and you are able to retrieve the first box you placed on that line, before any of each of the other boxes.

### Queue's Functionalities:

1. Enqueue: Added objects to queue.
2. Dequeue: Removed objects from the queue.
3. Front: First object in the queue(Firstly added).
4. Rear: Last object in the queue (Lastly added).
5. Peek & isEmpty act the exact same as stacks.
