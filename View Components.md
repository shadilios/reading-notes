## Pros:

1. Renders a chunk rather than a whole response.
2. Includes the same separation-of-concerns and testability benefits found between a controller and view.
3. Can have parameters and business logic.

## Performance: 

Based on several benchmarks, ViewComponents are ~10x faster than partials in real-world use-cases.
