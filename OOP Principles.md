### Phrases
1. Inheritance: The ability of a class to Inherit from another class, and as such, all objects created from said class will inherit all the Functions & Attributes from the root class.  
2. Virtual Method: A special type of function inside a class, that can be overridden to edit the whole function or parts of it if we still want to keep some of the main functionality.

### How to make a class Inherit from another class?

The following script is of a class Cat that inherits all the elements inside the Animal class:

```
public class Cat : Animal
    {
        
    }
```

### How to protect a class and make closed to any inheritance attempts?

The following script is of a "Sealed" Class, where the sealed keyword gives my class a protection against any type of inheritance

```
sealed class Currency
    {
        string currencyName;
        double value;
    }
```

### What is polymorphism?

It means the ability to fully or partially modify functions to suit each object instantiated as the image below shows

I basically Create a main function that handles a basic functionality that exists in all of my objects, and at the same time have the ability to modify these methods to suit each of my object needs & demands.

We usually call these types of methods Virtual methods (see Phrases part for more details).
