# Collections & Enums

### What are Collections?

Collections are a way to group objects in lists, we refrain from using this in the case of array of integers or strings and strictly to objects.  
Note: Lists are a built in collection in c# that we implemented before on our own in "Linked list" class.  
Note 2: They come with built in functions just like the built in functions we built for our linked list class.

### What are Enums?

Enums are a way in c# to equal set of values to a single variable, in this case that variable can only be on of the options you provide in the Enum.  
It's useful to refrain from rewriting specific values each time we need them.  

Example:  
```
enum myColors
{
    Red,
    Blue,
    Black,
    White
}
```
Each of these colors can equal something like a hexcode for example to have a set of colors that I will be using in my object.
