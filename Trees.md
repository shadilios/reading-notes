### Terminology

* Node: Just like previous data structrues, the node is an element inside our tree that holds data.
* Root: The main value and the beginning of the tree, or the highest priority value.
* K: Maximum number of children per Node.
* Left, Right: Reference to children of Node.
* Edge: The link between 2 nodes.
* Leaf: A node with no Children.
* Height: Number of linkes from root to the lowest leaf.
