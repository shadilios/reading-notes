## Swagger

Swagger(or OpenAPI) is a tool used for descriping REST APIs, its main uses are minimizing the time to connect & document services.

## Unit test

Just like we studied before, unit testing is a script that lets us test the output of functions compared to expected results.  
It can also be used to test the view returned by controllers & controllers logic in my application.  
<br>
Note: When unit testing controller logic, only the contents of a single action are tested.
