## Usage of cookies
1. Session Management.
2. Personalization.
3. Tracking.

## Prefixes

1. __Host-

If a cookie name has this prefix, it's accepted in a Set-Cookie header only if it's also marked with the Secure attribute,
was sent from a secure origin, does not include a Domain attribute, and has the Path attribute set to /. This way, these cookies can be seen as "domain-locked".  

2. __Secure-

If a cookie name has this prefix, it's accepted in a Set-Cookie header only
if it's marked with the Secure attribute and was sent from a secure origin. This is weaker than the __Host- prefix.
