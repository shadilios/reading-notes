### What is a Database?

A Database is a collection of Data that follow a specific structure to present a meaningful data that can be used as facts in our projects.  
An example of this is the MovieDB website we used in Prep course, where we could get data that was written by people on websites related to movies & we could present
& use them in our projects as a set of objects.

- Mutliple User Access:
 1. Admins: Users that moderate, edit & set access limits to other users.  
 2. End users: Users that benefit from processing data (example: scientist reading data that shows covid cases per country per day).
 3. Designers: Users that write the data and set the relations between their elements in a way that makes it presentable & processable.
