### What is open source

Open source is any application that's open to the general public to write code in, implement new features or fix any bugs.  
Just like visual studio community & Visual studio code we've been using in this course.

### Benefits & Details

1. Contributing to any open source will boost someone's career.
2. It might also be a factor of landing a job if the contribution was big & the owner of said application liked it.
3. Users should always read the contribution rules before attempting to write code.
4. Greatly improves coding skills when you write your code and see other's work.
5. Great way to get experience.
6. Improves software for the general public.

### Contribution

Just like any github repository, the contributor clones the project to their device & makes any edits or writes new code and then proceeds to push his work.  
However in this case, there should be an approval from someone who's directly or indirectly the "Owner" of said project.
